## Design

### Colours

The colour scheme was chosen to provide a simple, neutral and fresh look.

These colours were used throughout all the pages in such a way as to ensure adequate contrast and good user experience.
The red color #A43F2D seen in the header and footer for instance was chosen to be colorful but yet not taking over the content, and also match well with the plain white background and text. The grey #445261 also matches well with the other colors.

### Fonts

Google Fonts were implemented on the website. Lobster and Oswald with sans-serif as fallback was used thoughout the site to present the content in a clear and legible way.

### Structure

#### Website pages

Homepage, About Fodmap, Recipes, Add recipe, Recipe details, Favourite recipes, My recipes, search


#### Database

- The backend consists of Python built with the Django framework with a database of a Postgres for the deployed version
- Two database models contain all fields stored in the database and mimics the structure of what is actually stored in the Postgres database

## Testing

The testing approach is as follows:
1. Manual testing of user stories
2. Automated testing

### Manual testing of user stories

The user stories are found here: [User stories](https://github.com/users/Karasp1980/projects/7)
an here [User stories Issues](https://github.com/Karasp1980/Fodmap-recipes/issues)


![User stories](static/assets/images/userstories.png)


**Superuser / Admin**
- As a site Admin I can create, edit and delete recipes and comments so that I can manage the site content
- As a site Admin I can access the admin panel so that I can manage recipes and comments
- As a site Admin I can log out of the admin panel so that I can disconnect from the website

This was tested by accessing the Django Admin Panel. By creating a Superuser we can access the Django Admin Panel where the administrator can perform all the CRUD functionalitis

## Bugs

![Bugs](static/assets/images/bugs.png)

## Improvements

Possible future improvements of the site could be:

* Adding a field in the top of the recipe_details page with cooking time and number of portions
* A user info site where the user can update/edit/delet their userinfo details
* Get the unittest coverage up to 100%

## Github 
To create a new repository I took the following steps:

- Logged into Github.
- Clicked over to the â€˜repositoriesâ€™ section.
- Clicked the green â€˜newâ€™ button. This takes you to the create new repository page.
- Once there under â€˜repository templateâ€™ I chose the code institute template from the dropdown menu.
- I input a repository name then clicked the green â€˜create repository buttonâ€™ at the bottom of the page.
- Once created I opened the new repository and clicked the green â€˜Gitpodâ€™ button to create a workspace in Gitpod for editing.

## Django and Heroku 
- To get the Django framework installed and set up I followed the Code institutes [Django Blog cheatsheet](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fst/Django%20Blog%20Cheat%20Sheet%20v1.pdf)
