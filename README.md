## Design

### Colours

The colour scheme was chosen to provide simple, neutral and fresh look. It was an intention to keep the website for all range of users and avoid colour stereotype typically found in the gyms and sports centres such as bright green or blue.

These colours were used throughout all the pages in such a way as to ensure adequate contrast and good user experience.

The pallet created using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)

### Fonts

Google Fonts were implemented on the website. Lobster and Oswald with sans-serif as fallback was used thoughout the site to present the content in a clear and legible way.

### Structure

#### Website pages




#### Database

- The backend consists of Python built with the Django framework with a database of a Postgres for the deployed version
- Two database models contain all fields stored in the database and mimics the structure of what is actually stored in the Postgres database
